# Python_Challenge
Repo for third homework assignment in Data Analytics Bootcamp

I recognize that, because of some issues with files names, this is likely not the cleanest record of my work.
When I started the assignment, I opened secondary files to test small pieces of code and ended up building the majority of my code NOT in main.py for each problem.
Ultimately, I renamed my files to allign with the convention stated in the assignment, but this means some of the changes and deletions are a bit misrepresented.
I'm taking this, and my use of the repo, as a lesson for the next assignment, now that I can better appreciate coming back to github to look at previous versions of my code.
